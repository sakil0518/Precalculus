    <h2>Rectangular coordinates</h2>
    <p>Just as you can represent real numbers by points on a real number line, you can represent <strong>ordered <u>pairs</u> of real numbers</strong> by points in a plane called
      the <a href="https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_elementary-algebra/s06-01-rectangular-coordinate-system.html"target="_blank" title="rectangular coordinate system">rectangular coordinate system</a>.</p>
    <p>The Cartesian plane is formed by using two real number lines intersecting at right angles, as shown in Figure 1.1. The horizontal real number libe is usually called the x-axis, and the vertical real number line is usually called the y-axis. The point of intersection of theses two axes is called origin, and the two axes divide the plane into four parts called quadrants.<img src="rectangular coord.jpg"width=80%></p>
    <p style="margin-top:40px;">Each point in the plane corresponds to an ordered pair(x,y) of real numers x and y, called coordinates of the point. The x-soordinate represents the directed distance from the y-axis to the point, and the y-coordinate represent the directed distance from the x-axis to the point, as shown in Figure 1.2.</p>
